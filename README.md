Disclaimer: suboptimal in many ways, but more than enough for what I need.

## Command line args

`bs` accepts the following command line arguments:

`-p`: It checkouts to the selected branch and executes a `git pull`
    immediately afterwards.
`-u`: It executes a `git fetch` _before_ showing the branches to be selected. It's useful to update branches before diplay.
