# Branch search

A simple terminal branch search for git

## Install

You can install branchsearch by cloning the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/npazosmendez/branchsearch.git`

Go into the repository's folder and run (if you want it automatically installed):

`sudo make install`

Otherwise you may run

`make`

and copy the generated exectable (`bs`) to your preferred location.

#### Disclaimer

Suboptimal in many ways, but more than enough for what I need.
